# ERC20 CrowdSale - KaseiCoin (Mars in Japanese)

KaseiCoin will is a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. This project will launch a crowdsale that will allow people buy KaseiCoin with Ether.

The main smart contract consists of a deployer with two smart contracts within: a crowdsale contract and a contract creating the KaseiCoin.
The contracts satisfy ERC20 requirements using OpenZeppelin. The folder,  Evidence, contains the video depicting the deploying of each contract, as well as evidence of the creation of the coin and the execution of the crowdsale.


## Technologies

The program is based on Solidity 3 and uses Remix, Metamask and Ganache.

Ganache <br>
Ganache is a personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum and Filecoin distributed application development. You can use Ganache across the entire development cycle; enabling you to develop, deploy, and test your dApps in a safe and deterministic environment.

Remix <br>
Remix, more commonly known as Remix IDE, is an open-source Ethereum IDE you can use to write, compile and debug Solidity code.

Metamask <br>
MetaMask is the leading self-custodial wallet. The safe and simple way to access blockchain applications and web3.
